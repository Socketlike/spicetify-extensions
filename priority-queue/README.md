<h2 align="center">priority queue</h2>
  
ever wanted to requeue a track and have them play instantly after the current one ends without literally moving the track upwards after queuing it?

this plugin allows you to queue your stuff at the top of the queue instead of the bottom.

i made this for myself; don't expect support
